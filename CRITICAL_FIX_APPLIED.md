# 🔧 Critical Fix Applied - Service Details Page Error

## ❌ Problem Encountered

When clicking on service details, the page was throwing a **500 Internal Server Error** with the following error in the browser console:

```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')
    at CounterSection2 (CounterSection2.jsx:8:17)
```

### Root Cause

The `CounterSection2` component requires a `data` prop containing an array of counter items, but the service details pages were calling it without passing any data:

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Missing data prop
<CounterSection2 />
```

The component tries to map over the data:
```javascript
{data.map((item, index) => (...))}  // data is undefined!
```

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Fixed Files

#### 1. `src/app/(innerpage)/service/service-[slug]/page.jsx`
- Added `counterData` array with 4 counter items
- Updated CounterSection2 call to pass the data prop:
  ```javascript
  <CounterSection2 data={counterData} />
  ```

#### 2. `src/app/(innerpage)/service/[slug]/page.jsx`
- Added `counterData` array with 4 counter items
- Updated CounterSection2 call to pass the data prop:
  ```javascript
  <CounterSection2 data={counterData} />
  ```

### Counter Data Structure

```javascript
const counterData = [
  {
    iconSrc: "/assets/img/icons/counter_icon_1.png",
    countTo: 567,
    suffix: "+",
    title: "Active Clients",
  },
  {
    iconSrc: "/assets/img/icons/counter_icon_2.png",
    countTo: 23,
    suffix: "K+",
    title: "Team Support",

  {
