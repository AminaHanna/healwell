## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Auto-slug Generation
- Type a title like "My Awesome Blog"
- Slug automatically becomes "my-awesome-blog"
- Slugs are used in URLs

### Publishing Blogs
- Uncheck "Publish" to save as draft
- Check "Publish" to make it live
- Only published blogs appear on frontend

### Service Display Order
- Lower numbers appear first
- Use 1, 2, 3 for ordering
- Leave blank for default

### Featured Images
- Use full URLs (https://...)
- Images must be publicly accessible
- Recommended: 1200x600px

### Required Fields
