2. Clicks "Team Members" tab
3. Adds/edits/deletes team members
4. Changes appear immediately on pages

### Frontend Workflow
1. Home page loads
2. TeamSection component mounts
3. Fetches from `/api/team-members?active_only=true`
4. Displays team members in carousel
5. Same for About page

  display_order INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_team_members_is_active ON team_members(is_active);
CREATE INDEX idx_team_members_display_order ON team_members(display_order);
```
