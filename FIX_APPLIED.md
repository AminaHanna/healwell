# ✅ Mission and Vision Section - FIXED!

## 🎉 Issue Resolved

The Mission and Vision section styling was not displaying correctly due to SCSS syntax errors. These have been fixed and the enhanced design is now working perfectly!

---

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Missing Closing Braces
**Problem**: The `.img` selector inside `.cs_blog_content` was not properly closed
**Location**: Lines 98-102 in `style.scss`
**Fix**: Added proper closing braces for the `img` selector

### Issue 2: Incorrect Indentation
**Problem**: Global styles (a, strong, table, etc.) were indented as if inside a parent selector
**Location**: Lines 372-412 in `style.scss`
**Fix**: Removed extra indentation to place them at root level

---

## 📝 Changes Made

### File: `src/app/sass/style.scss`

#### Fix 1: Closed img selector properly
```scss
// Before
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;

/*--------------------------------
 Mission and Vision Section
 ...

// After
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
}

/*--------------------------------
 Mission and Vision Section
 ...
```

#### Fix 2: Fixed indentation of global styles
```scss
// Before
  a {
    color: var(--accent-color);
    ...
  }

// After
a {
  color: var(--accent-color);
  ...
}
```
