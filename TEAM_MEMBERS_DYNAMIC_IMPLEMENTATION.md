# ✅ Team Members Dynamic Implementation - COMPLETE

## 🎉 Project Status: SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED

The Team Section is now fully dynamic, fetching team member data from Supabase instead of using hardcoded data.

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. ✅ Database Table Created
- **Table**: `team_members`
- **Fields**:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `name` (TEXT) - Team member's full name
  - `position` (TEXT) - Job title or role
  - `image_url` (TEXT) - Profile image URL
  - `bio` (TEXT) - Short bio or description
  - `social_links` (JSONB) - Social media links (facebook, twitter, instagram, pinterest)
  - `display_order` (INTEGER) - Order in which to display
  - `is_active` (BOOLEAN) - Whether to show this member
  - `created_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ) - Creation timestamp
  - `updated_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ) - Last update timestamp
- **Indexes**: `is_active`, `display_order` for performance

### 2. ✅ API Endpoint Created
- **File**: `src/app/api/team-members/route.js`
- **Operations**:
  - **GET**: Fetch all team members (supports `?active_only=true` filter)
  - **POST**: Create new team member
  - **PUT**: Update existing team member
  - **DELETE**: Delete team member by ID

### 3. ✅ Admin Components Created
- **TeamMembersManager.jsx**: Main manager component with CRUD logic

### 4. ✅ Admin Dashboard Updated
- Added "Team Members" tab (👥) to admin navigation
- Integrated TeamMembersManager component
- Tab appears between Careers and Settings

### 5. ✅ TeamSection Component Updated
- Now fetches team data from `/api/team-members` endpoint
- Falls back to provided data if available
- Handles loading and error states
- Transforms API data to component format

### 6. ✅ Pages Updated
- **Home Page** (`/`): Removed hardcoded team data
- **About Page** (`/about`): Removed hardcoded team data
- Both pages now use dynamic TeamSection

### 7. ✅ Initial Data Seeded

<TeamSection
  hr={true}
  variant={'cs_pagination cs_style_2'}
/>

// Mode 2: Use provided data (backward compatible)
<TeamSection
  hr={true}
  variant={'cs_pagination cs_style_2'}
  data={customTeamData}
/>
```
