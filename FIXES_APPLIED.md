# ðŸ”§ Fixes Applied - Careers CSS & Service URL Structure

## âœ… Issue 1: Careers Management CSS Styling - FIXED

### Problem
The Careers Management section in the admin dashboard was not displaying correctly. CSS styling was not being applied properly.

### Solution Applied

#### 1. Updated CareersManager.jsx
- Changed CSS classes to match BlogManager pattern
- Updated from custom classes to standard admin classes:
  - `admin-section` â†’ `careers-manager`
  - `admin-section-header` â†’ `manager-header`
  - `admin-btn admin-btn-primary` â†’ `cs_btn cs_style_1`
  - `admin-loading` â†’ `loading`
  - `admin-empty` â†’ (removed, now uses empty-state)

#### 2. Updated CareersForm.jsx
- Changed form modal classes to match BlogForm pattern:
  - `admin-form-modal` â†’ `form-modal-overlay`
  - `admin-form-overlay` â†’ `form-modal-overlay`
  - `admin-form-container` â†’ `form-modal`
  - `admin-form-header` â†’ `form-header`
  - `admin-form-close` â†’ `close-btn`
  - `admin-form` â†’ `career-form`
- Updated button classes:
  - `admin-btn admin-btn-secondary` â†’ `cs_btn cs_style_2`
  - `admin-btn admin-btn-primary` â†’ `cs_btn cs_style_1`

#### 3. Updated CareersList.jsx
- Added empty state handling
- Changed table wrapper classes to match ServiceList pattern
- Updated table structure to use consistent CSS classes:
  - Added `career-title` div for job title display
  - Updated status badge classes to use `status-badge`
  - Updated action button classes to use `btn-edit` and `btn-delete`
  - Added `table-responsive` wrapper

#### 4. Enhanced admin.scss
- Added `select` element styling:
  - Full width with proper padding
  - Custom dropdown arrow styling
  - Focus states with blue accent color
  - Disabled state styling
- Added `.checkbox-label` styling for career form checkboxes
- Extended table styling to support `.career-title` class
- All styles follow the Medilo color scheme (blue #002261, accent #2ea6f7)

### Result
âœ… Careers Management now has professional styling matching Blogs and Services sections
âœ… Form displays correctly with proper spacing and colors
âœ… Table displays with consistent styling
âœ… All buttons and inputs are properly styled
âœ… Responsive design maintained

## âœ… Issue 2: Service Details URL Structure - FIXED

### Problem
Service details pages were using `/service/[slug]` pattern, but needed to use `/service/service-[slug]` pattern (e.g., `/service/service-cardiology` instead of `/service/cardiology`).

### Solution Applied

#### 1. Created New Route Structure
- Created new directory: `src/app/(innerpage)/service/service-[slug]/`
- Created new page: `src/app/(innerpage)/service/service-[slug]/page.jsx`
- Handles both old and new URL patterns for backward compatibility
- Strips "service-" prefix from slug when querying database

#### 2. Updated Service Page Links
- **File:** `src/app/(innerpage)/service/page.jsx`
- Changed link pattern from `/service/service-details?slug=${service.slug}`
- To: `/service/service-${service.slug}`
- Now generates proper URLs like `/service/service-cardiology`

#### 3. Updated Home Page Links
- **File:** `src/app/(home1)/page.jsx`
- Updated all 8 service links to use new pattern:
  - `/service/service-pharmacology`
  - `/service/service-orthopedic`
  - `/service/service-hematology`
  - `/service/service-plastic-surgery`
  - `/service/service-neurology`
  - `/service/service-ophthalmology`
  - `/service/service-dental-care`
  - `/service/service-cardiology`

#### 4. Updated Footer Links
- **File:** `src/app/Components/Footer/Footer.jsx`
- Updated all service footer links to use new pattern:
  - `/service/service-plastic-surgery`
  - `/service/service-pharmacology`
  - `/service/service-dental-care`
  - `/service/service-cardiology`
  - `/service/service-orthopedic`

#### 5. API Compatibility
- API endpoint `/api/services` remains unchanged
- Queries database using clean slug (without "service-" prefix)
- Backward compatible with existing database records

### Result
âœ… Service details pages now use `/service/service-[slug]` pattern
âœ… All links updated across the application
âœ… SEO-friendly URLs with descriptive slugs
âœ… Backward compatible with existing services
âœ… Consistent URL structure throughout the site
