# üîß Bug Fix - Import Error

## Issue
There was a duplicate import of `dynamic` in `BlogForm.jsx`:

```javascript
// ‚ùå WRONG - dynamic imported twice
import React, { useState, useEffect, dynamic } from 'react';
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
```

This caused the error:
```
Error: the name `dynamic` is defined multiple times
```

## Solution
Removed `dynamic` from the React import since it should only come from `next/dynamic`:

```javascript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
```

## Files Fixed
- `src/app/admin/components/BlogForm.jsx`

## Status
‚úÖ **FIXED** - Development server should now run without errors

## Next Steps
1. The dev server should now compile successfully
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/admin`
3. Create blog posts and services with the rich text editor
4. View published content at `/blog/[slug]` and `/service/[slug]`
