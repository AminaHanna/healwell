# ‚úÖ Final Fixes Applied

## Issue 1: Careers Form - Data Entry Not Working

### Problem
Users couldn't enter data in the "Add Career" form in the admin dashboard. The form was blocked.

### Root Cause
There were two overlapping modal overlays with the same class name, blocking user interaction:
```javascript
// ‚ùå WRONG - Two overlays blocking the form
<div className="form-modal-overlay">
  <div className="form-modal-overlay" onClick={onCancel}></div>
  <div className="form-modal">
```

### Solution Applied
Fixed the modal structure in `src/app/admin/components/CareersForm.jsx`:
```javascript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Proper overlay structure
<div className="form-modal-overlay" onClick={onCancel}>
  <div className="form-modal" onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}>
```

**Changes:**
- Removed duplicate overlay div
- Added `onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}` to prevent closing when clicking inside the form
- Now users can enter data in all form fields

### Result
‚úÖ Careers form is now fully functional
‚úÖ Users can enter job title, department, location, etc.
‚úÖ Rich text editors work for description, requirements, and benefits
‚úÖ Form can be submitted successfully
