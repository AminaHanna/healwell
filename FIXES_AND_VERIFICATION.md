# Fixes and Verification Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Storage Bucket Error: "Bucket not found"

**Problem**: 
```
Error uploading image: StorageApiError: Bucket not found
```

**Root Cause**: 
The application was trying to upload images to `blog-images` and `service-images` storage buckets that don't exist in the Supabase project.

**Solution Implemented**:

#### A. Created Image Upload Utility (`src/lib/imageUpload.js`)
- Centralized image upload logic
- Better error handling with specific error messages
- Graceful fallback for missing buckets
- Support for image deletion
- Bucket creation helper function

#### B. Updated BlogForm and ServiceForm
- Now use the new `uploadImage` utility function
- Better error messages for users
- Improved file naming with timestamps and random strings
- Proper error handling and user feedback

#### C. How to Fix the Error

**Step 1: Create Storage Buckets in Supabase**

Go to your Supabase project dashboard:
1. Click "Storage" in the left sidebar
2. Click "New bucket"
3. Create bucket named: `blog-images`
   - Make sure "Public bucket" is CHECKED
4. Click "New bucket" again
5. Create bucket named: `service-images`
   - Make sure "Public bucket" is CHECKED

**Step 2: Verify Buckets Are Created**
- You should see both buckets in the Storage section
- Both should show as "public"

**Step 3: Test Image Upload**
- Go to Admin Dashboard
- Create a new blog post
- Upload an image
- You should see the preview and no error message

### 2. ✅ HTML Content Rendering

**Status**: Already Correctly Implemented ✓

The application is already properly rendering HTML content from React Quill without showing raw HTML tags.

**Verification**:

#### BlogsLeft Component (`src/app/Components/BlogsDetailsSide/BlogsLeft.jsx`)
```jsx
{data?.content && data.content.length > 0 ? (
  data.content.map((paragraph, index) => (
    data.isHtmlContent ? (
      <div
        key={index}
        className="cs_blog_content"
        dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: paragraph }}
      />
    ) : (
      <p key={index}>{paragraph}</p>
    )
  ))
) : (
  <p>No content available</p>
)}
```

**How it works**:
1. Checks if `isHtmlContent` is true
2. Uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to render HTML
3. CSS class `cs_blog_content` provides styling
4. Users see formatted text, not HTML tags

#### ServiceSection4 Component (`src/app/Components/Service/ServiceSection4.jsx`)
- Uses the same pattern for service descriptions
- Properly renders HTML content with formatting

#### Blog Details Page (`src/app/(innerpage)/blog/[slug]/page.jsx`)
- Sets `isHtmlContent: true` when passing data to BlogsLeft
- Content from React Quill is properly rendered

#### Service Details Page (`src/app/(innerpage)/service/[slug]/page.jsx`)
- Sets `isHtmlContent: true` when passing data to ServiceSection4
- Service descriptions are properly rendered

   - For blogs: Create `blog-images` bucket (public)
   - For services: Create `service-images` bucket (public)
4. Try uploading again

### Issue: Image preview shows but upload fails

**Possible Causes**:
1. Bucket doesn't exist (see above)
2. Bucket is not public
3. Storage permissions are restricted

**Solution**:
