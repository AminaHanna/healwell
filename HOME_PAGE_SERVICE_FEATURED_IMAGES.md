# ✅ Home Page Service Cards - Updated to Use Dynamic Featured Images

## Summary

The "OUR BEST SERVICE" section on the home page (`src/app/(home1)/page.jsx`) has been updated to use dynamic service featured images instead of a hardcoded background image for all cards.

---

## What Changed

### File Modified
- **`src/app/(home1)/page.jsx`** (Line 509)

### Before
```javascript
const mappedServices = data.slice(0, 6).map((service, index) => ({
  backgroundImage: '/assets/img/service_bg.jpg',  // ❌ Hardcoded for all cards
  iconUrl: service.icon || '/assets/img/icons/service_icon_1.png',
  index: String(index + 1).padStart(2, '0'),
  title: service.title,
  subtitle: service.short_description || service.description || 'Medical service',
  link: `/service/${service.slug}`,
}));
```

### After
```javascript
const mappedServices = data.slice(0, 6).map((service, index) => ({
  backgroundImage: service.featured_image || '/assets/img/service_bg.jpg',  // ✅ Dynamic per service
  iconUrl: service.icon || '/assets/img/icons/service_icon_1.png',
  index: String(index + 1).padStart(2, '0'),
  title: service.title,
  subtitle: service.short_description || service.description || 'Medical service',
  link: `/service/${service.slug}`,
}));
```

## How It Works

### Service Card Background Image Flow

```
1. Home Page Loads
   ↓
2. Fetch Services from /api/services?active=true
   ↓
3. For Each Service (up to 6):
   - Use service.featured_image as background
   - If no featured_image, use default /assets/img/service_bg.jpg
   ↓
4. Render Service Cards with Dynamic Backgrounds
   ↓
5. Display on Home Page
```

### Data Structure
```javascript
{
  backgroundImage: "https://rdqczsmrxuzlouiflchq.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/service-images/...",
  iconUrl: "/assets/img/icons/service_icon_1.png",
  index: "01",
  title: "Service Title",
  subtitle: "Service Description",
  link: "/service/service-slug"
}
```

## Benefits

✅ **Consistent with Service Listing Page** - Same pattern used everywhere
✅ **Per-Service Customization** - Each service displays its own featured image
✅ **Fallback Support** - Default image if no featured_image is set
✅ **No Hardcoding** - All images come from database
✅ **Professional Appearance** - Each service card has unique visual identity
✅ **Easy to Update** - Admins can change images through admin panel

---

## Testing

### Step 1: Verify Home Page Service Cards
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/` (home page)
2. Scroll to "OUR BEST SERVICE" section
3. Service cards should display with their featured images as backgrounds
4. If a service has no featured_image, it falls back to the default

### Step 2: Test with Different Services
1. Create a new service in admin with a featured image
2. Go to home page
3. New service should display with its image as background (if in top 6)

### Step 3: Verify Fallback
1. Create a service without uploading a featured image
2. Go to home page
3. Service should display with default background image

### Step 4: Compare with Service Listing Page
1. Go to `/service` page
2. Verify service cards display the same featured images
3. Both pages should be consistent

---

## Consistency Across Pages

### Service Listing Page (`/service`)
```javascript
backgroundImage: service.featured_image || '/assets/img/service_bg.jpg'
```

### Home Page (`/`)
```javascript
backgroundImage: service.featured_image || '/assets/img/service_bg.jpg'
```

✅ **Both pages now use the same pattern!**

---

## API Endpoint Used

### GET /api/services?active=true
Returns all active services with their data including `featured_image`

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "uuid",
    "title": "Service Name",
    "slug": "service-slug",
    "description": "...",
    "short_description": "...",
    "featured_image": "https://...",
    "icon": "...",
    "active": true,
    "display_order": 0,
    "created_at": "...",
    "updated_at": "..."
  }
]
```

## Other Home Page Variants

### Home V2 (`/home-v2`)
- Uses `ServiceSection2` component
- Does NOT use `backgroundImage` property
- No changes needed

### Home V3 (`/home-v3`)
- Uses `ServiceSection3` component
- Uses `bgImagUrl` property (hardcoded in component data)
- Could be updated in future if needed
