# âœ… Blog Slug Structure & Careers Form UI Updated

## Issue 1: Blog Slug Structure - Updated to `/blog/[slug]`

### Problem

- Changed: `/blog/blog-details?slug=${blog.slug}`
- To: `/blog/${blog.slug}`

**2. `src/app/(home1)/page.jsx`**
- Updated all 4 blog links to use `/blog/[slug]` pattern:
  - `/blog/medical-health-blog`
  - `/blog/hospital-thing`
  - `/blog/infection-prevention`
  - `/blog/medical-health-blog-2`

**3. `src/app/home-v2/page.jsx`**
- Updated all 4 blog links to use `/blog/[slug]` pattern

**4. `src/app/home-v3/page.jsx`**
- Updated all 4 blog links to use `/blog/[slug]` pattern

**5. `src/app/Components/Footer/Footer.jsx`**
- Updated footer blog links to use `/blog/[slug]` pattern:
  - `/blog/solution-york-blog`
  - `/blog/medical-working-health`

**6. `src/app/Components/Header/Header.jsx`**
- Updated header blog details link to `/blog/medical-health-blog`
