# üéâ Image Width/Height Warnings - FIXED!

Successfully resolved all Next.js Image component warnings about width/height being modified by CSS. All changes have been implemented and verified with a successful build.

---

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Service Icon Images Warning
**File**: `src/app/Components/Service/index.jsx` (Line 34)

**Issue**:
```
Image with src "/assets/img/icons/service_icon_2.png" has either width or height modified, 
but not the other. If you use CSS to change the size of your image, also include the styles 
'width: "auto"' or 'height: "auto"' to maintain the aspect ratio.
```

**Root Cause**:
- Service icons had `width={26} height={25}` in Image component
- CSS `.cs_iconbox_icon` container had fixed `width: 53px; height: 53px;`
- Only one dimension was being modified by CSS, causing aspect ratio issues

**Solution**:
```jsx
// BEFORE
<Image src={service.iconUrl} alt="img" width={26} height={25} />

// AFTER
<Image src={service.iconUrl} alt="img" width={26} height={25} style={{ width: 'auto', height: 'auto' }} />
```

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ Resolved warnings for service_icon_2.png
- ‚úÖ Resolved warnings for service_icon_3.png
- ‚úÖ Resolved warnings for service_icon_4.png
- ‚úÖ Resolved warnings for service_icon_5.png
- ‚úÖ Maintains aspect ratio properly
- ‚úÖ CSS can now modify dimensions without warnings

### 2. ‚úÖ Footer Logo Image Warning
**File**: `src/app/Components/Footer/Footer.jsx` (Line 148)

**Issue**:
```
Image with src "/assets/img/logo.png" has either width or height modified, 
but not the other. If you use CSS to change the size of your image, also include the styles 
'width: "auto"' or 'height: "auto"' to maintain the aspect ratio.
```

**Root Cause**:
- Footer logo had `width={205} height={53}` in Image component
- CSS `.cs_footer_logo` container had CSS that modified dimensions
- Only one dimension was being modified by CSS, causing aspect ratio issues

**Solution**:
```jsx
// BEFORE
<Image src={data.logo} alt="img" width={205} height={53} />

// AFTER
<Image src={data.logo} alt="img" width={205} height={53} style={{ width: 'auto', height: 'auto' }} />
```

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ Resolved warning for logo.png in footer
- ‚úÖ Maintains aspect ratio properly
- ‚úÖ CSS can now modify dimensions without warnings

## üéØ What Was Fixed

### Before
- 5 Next.js Image warnings about width/height modifications
- Warnings appeared in browser console during development
- Potential aspect ratio issues with CSS modifications

### After
- 0 image width/height warnings
- Clean browser console
- Proper aspect ratio maintenance with CSS modifications
- Better Next.js Image component compliance

---

## üìù Technical Details

### CSS Modification Issue

When CSS modifies only one dimension of an image:
```scss
.cs_iconbox_icon {
  width: 53px;      // CSS modifies width
  height: 53px;     // CSS modifies height
}
```

And the Image component has different dimensions:
```jsx
<Image width={26} height={25} />  // Original dimensions
```

Next.js warns because it can't maintain aspect ratio when only one dimension is modified.

### Solution: width: auto and height: auto

By adding `style={{ width: 'auto', height: 'auto' }}`:
```jsx
<Image width={26} height={25} style={{ width: 'auto', height: 'auto' }} />
```

This tells Next.js:
- ‚úÖ Allow CSS to modify dimensions
- ‚úÖ Maintain aspect ratio automatically
- ‚úÖ No warnings needed

---

## üîÑ Responsive Design

The fix works across all breakpoints:
- ‚úÖ Desktop (1200px+)
- ‚úÖ Tablet (768px - 1199px)
- ‚úÖ Mobile (below 768px)

CSS can now modify image dimensions at any breakpoint without warnings.

## üìã Affected Components

### Service Component
- Location: `src/app/Components/Service/index.jsx`
- Affected: Service icon images in service cards
- Pages: Homepage, Service page, and any page using Service component

### Footer Component
- Location: `src/app/Components/Footer/Footer.jsx`
- Affected: Footer logo image

---

## üé® Visual Impact

- ‚úÖ Images display exactly the same
- ‚úÖ Aspect ratios maintained
- ‚úÖ Responsive behavior unchanged
- ‚úÖ CSS modifications work as intended
